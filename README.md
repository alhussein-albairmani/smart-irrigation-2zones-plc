# Smart Irrigation Control System

This project is a smart irrigation system for two zones using Siemens TIA Portal.  
It automatically controls the main water pump and valves based on analog soil moisture sensors.  
The system ensures only one valve operates at a time to prevent overlap.  
It supports manual and automatic modes via a selector switch, with priority control and interlocking for reliable operation.
